# Purpose: Input file for the project
# Simply a place to store the input data for the query

# For examlpe, if you want to store the code for the project, you can paste it here, and 
# then use [code] in the prompt to use it, such as prompt='Here is the [code] for the project'
# the [code] will be autimatically replaced with the code below before sending it to the chat bot. You can do the same for any other
# input you want to store, such as a readme file, or anything else you want to store
# and don't forget to import it in the main.py file and tweak the code, if you want to create another variable (code is already imported and works)
